      "• Immense Strength: Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage of cursed energy, as he can destroy walls with ease, throw a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost, and even throw a car.\n",
      "• Immense Speed and Reflexes: Yuji is shown to have great speed and can finish a 50-meter track within 3 seconds, implying he can run at speeds of 60.12km/h (37.3mph). He's also been shown to dodge the attacks of all five opposing sorcerers from the students from Kyoto Jujutsu High who tried to murder him.\n",
      "• Immense Durability: Yuji's durability surpasses the average sorcerer. He was able to continuously take hits from Choso during their fight and even Piercing Blood, an attack moving at the speed of sound didn't pierce Yuji immediately.\n",
      "• Immense Stamina: Fitting his other superhuman capabilities, Yuji possesses a large amount of stamina and has often been shown continuing to fight despite grievous injuries for longer periods of time without rest, such as having his hand severed and his fingers disintegrated when battling the Finger Bearer, allowing for Megumi to escape with Nobara.\n",
      "• Proficient Learner: Yuji is a curious person and an earnest student. He is also good at progressing - being quick at Satoru's Movie Appreciation Training, and realizing Aoi Todo's advice quickly. According to Akutami, he is the best at cooking among the first years trio. He was able to master using martial arts alongside cursed energy and honed it to a level with which he can take on Special Grade curses. He was even able to use Black Flash four times in a row a short time after he had even learnt of its existence.\n"
